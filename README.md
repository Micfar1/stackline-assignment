# stackline-assignment
This is an assignment I wrote for stackline. They loved it and I moved onto the next rounds! I'm keeping it here because I think it is a good measure of some aspects of what I am capable of.

## Where can I see the result?
Currently the result is available at https://stackline-assignment.web.app/
